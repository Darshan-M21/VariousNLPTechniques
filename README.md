# Analysis of various NLP techniques and their applications

Under this mini project, we have analyzed various algorithms starting from ML models, deep learning models, RNN, LSTM and finally the LLM for the text keyword extracrion techniques
We have also worked on some applications like semantic segmentation and spam classifiers

Thank you
